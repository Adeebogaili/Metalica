            Metallica is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist/guitarist
            James Hetfield and drummer
            Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career.[1][2] The band's fast tempos,
            instrumentals and aggressive
            musicianship made them one of the founding "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and
            Slayer. Metallica's current
            lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk
            Hammett, and bassist Robert
            Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine (who went on to form Megadeth after being fired from the band) and
            bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff
            Burton (who died in a bus accident in Sweden in 1986) and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.

            After two albums on Megaforce Records and signing to major label Elektra in 1984, Metallica first found
            commercial success with the release
            of its third album, Master of Puppets (1986), which has been described as one of the heaviest and most
            influential thrash metal albums.
            Their next album, ...And Justice for All (1988), was also successful and gave Metallica their first Grammy
            Award nomination.
            Its eponymous fifth album, Metallica (1991), the band's first not to root predominantly in thrash metal,
            appealed to a more mainstream audience,
            achieving substantial commercial success and selling over 16 million copies in the United States to date,
            making it the best-selling album of
            the SoundScan era. After experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent releases, the band
            returned to its thrash metal roots
            with the release of its ninth album, Death Magnetic (2008), which drew similar praise to that of the band's
            earlier albums. Their most recent
            album is Hardwired... to Self-Destruct, released in 2016.
